# Errors

When you make an API call you may receive an error message in response. Either there is something wrong with your request or something went wrong on our end. Errors respond with an error code and JSON that contains a more precise message, description and API code.



The  API uses the following error codes:


Error Code | Meaning
---------- | -------
401 | Unauthorized -- Invalid email or password.
404 | Not Found -- The specified product could not be found.
